IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
                        <p>We will provide you with prior notice of any scheduled changes to the Services you are using. Changes to Legal Terms will become effective seven (7) days after the notice is given, except if the changes apply to bug fixes, security updates, and new functionality, in which case the changes will be effective immediately.
